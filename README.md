ALWAYS SAVE THEM IN DIFFERENT FILES AND EXECUTE THEM ONE BY ONE. OR IT WILL NOT WORK.

Info:

How to use swordfight script:
execute and take out your sword, it will kill everyone in games that don't have it patched

How to use loopgod script:
You cannot use your sword while you have godmode, instead, when your character's hair falls off, you can equip your sword.
It will tp them and glue them to your character, drag them to the edge of the map and fall into the void with them.
You will also not get killed by a sword.
Note: You respawn with godmode every 2 seconds, it will be useful to use both.

How to use both:
Execute both SEPARATELY.
You can use the godmode to drag players and not get damaged.
When you respawn automatically after 2 seconds, take out your sword before you character loses his hair, if he does, then you will drag players.
If he doesn't, then you can kill all players with the sword.

If you have any more questions, post it in the issue tab.
